<h2>I will explain more about this site!</h2>

The back end of this site is built on the Flask framework and SQLAlchemy. The goods, comments, login/logout system, and basket are all based on SQL. Users are able to change the settings of their profile, including their username, email, and password. If a user forgets their password, they can reset it on the profile page or receive instructions via email.

Some sections of the site are blocked, such as the ability to write comments or check the basket if a user is not logged in. Users can also log in to the system using their Google account.

The website also features a search system for goods.

There are many features based on JS in the front end as well, but I recommend that you explore them for yourself here: __https://nike-shop-fc325e1ea072.herokuapp.com/base__
